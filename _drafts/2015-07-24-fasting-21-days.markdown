## Day 9/10 8/02 ##

Well nowadays I have been feeling perfectly fine. I have no need to eat lol, I feel energetic, and also its just overall refreshing! I have told my friends about it and they are all pretty amazed haha. Of course, there are those that think its cool and want to try it and then there are those that are negative and think I should stop. Either way I think its pretty cool that I am experiencing this.

I think I had my dark bad poop yesterday, not exactly sure since it wasn’t so bad. At this point Im pretty sure that my body is cleansed, and is working itself out slowly. I have eaten ice cream bars the past two nights (that is bc I partied till 3am both nights :)




## Day 6 - Wed 7/29 ##

Well I haven’t been keeping track of my past few days because I went back to the U.S. My stomach feels fine. Sometimes my body feels woozy still. I noticed that I get tired randomly, and then feel energetic again randomly too. It really is weird, is this my body adjusting, or is this just normal for this kind of thing?

Anyways, I have found that I am slowly losing my peace of mind and calm at heart when I came back to the U.S. I lost it when I talked to my mom about it. She is very close-minded about bigu (can you blame her?) and also she somehow brings out the little kid in me. The one that gets mad quickly. How do I keep my peace?

It’s a long road but I have to work at it!



## Day 2 - Sat 7/25/15 ##

"There are two most important days in a man's life: the day he is born and the day he finds out why."

Today I feel like I have woken up from a long slumber: one that I have been in since forever.  After today's session, it really is incredible how perspective changes in my past two days. Actually, I don't think anything in me changed: I have always been me, but I can finally see things clearly.

I want to be a good person. I want to put my effort into being a good person. It's the universal calling, it is my calling.

I have been living life blind, afraid, asleep. No more.

My stomach has been hurting the past two days and I kept thinking that it was hunger. It wasn't. It was my body fixing itself. Big sis put her hands on my stomach and they felt warm, yet her hands were cold. After that stomach stopped hurting. She is now 神功大姐.

In the session, there was a little history about bigu. It is older than all the religions. It came out over 10k years ago and is only passed down via master-disciple. There is no literature on the subject, only spoken. Many falsely associate it with Buddhism or Daoism. Buddha used bigu to reach his enlightenment. 老子never understood bigu, but wrote a lot on the idea of the 道. However, the 道 from 老子 is not the same and the way of the world. The real enlightened people often find recluse in the mountains and do not join the politics of man. Bigu as a technique is not mutually exclusive from other religions, in fact, other religions embrace it and incorporate it into their teaching.

I am insignificant. There is no I. What we call I or me is just another part of the world. Everyone, everything, according to the way of the world.

Slept at 11, woke up at 5am, refreshed.



## Day 0 - 7/23/2015 ##
It is Thu 7/23. We went to visit a company near Tianjin this morning, and in the afternoon drove to the Bi Gu place. It was tricky to get there, driver kept getting lost. It was really dirty and poor for a long stretch, then all of a sudden there was this beautiful (relatively) park in the middle of the slum. It has a hotel, pond, koi fish, bridges, etc.. The hotel room isn't as nice as the Lavande hotel (it smells, no wifi) but the scenery outside made up for it (a little). I slept pretty much all the way in the car and when we arrive I hopped on the bed and slept more.

## Day 1 - Fri 7/24/15 ##
Well it's been an interesting day. Last night I had diahrrea and wasn't hungry, did not eat dinner. Woke up this morning not that hungry. My dad brought food over from last night. I had like a bite and then threw it away bc I knew there was to be no eating today.

So, today has been extremely long. Woke up again at 5am, went for a walk and then read until 10am, when the first assembly took place.

Okay, so the place was pretty big, ~250 ppl and was packed. It was stuffy and kinda hot (they had ac but not enough). It was sermon style (like Citylife). We sat in the fourth row: it was me, dad, sun, chen sis, her classmate.

So the teacher, who is called ziyin, is this skinny guy who smiles a lot. I think he is skinny because of bi gu and overwork. He talked a lot about his life, which I first found ehhh but it was interesting. He is one of those transcendents who gives. Believes in karma, the dao, Buddha, etc. He admires the culture of the old Chinese, before the communists, and hopes to one day promote it to China and the world.

I too, believe that the old Chinese culture needs a comeback. New Chinese culture is about greed and corruption, fueled by seeming inexplicable amounts of money. Just look at the internationals? This teacher sees that, and actively tries to fight it, he doesn't want China to have that reputation (unfortunately it already does: he knows that too from his travels). He is not without his faults tho, he is very biased against the Japanese (he spent time in military) and does not know about other religions as well. I respect what he is doing in regards to Chinese culture, it is something worth investigating.

Bi Gu, is very much like fasting. The lady says that in other cultures it is just not eating, whereas bigu is Chinese only. I don't agree that fasting is not eating: there is a very spiritual/religious element to fasting that is very similar to what the Chinese call bigu. The fact that bigu is Chinese is undeniable, it is actually developed here earlier(?) or maybe just separately from the rest of the world.

The basic principle is peace of mind combined with not eating. Not eating is only possible in combination with the right inner state (otherwise you starve and die). Bigu seeks to replace the energy from caloric intake with energy from the natural universe. How that energy transfers into us, I do not yet know. However, the teacher has said that it's the energy in the room that makes it possible (this is exactly like the big Christian speakers that use the energy in the room as well).

The spiritual elements here involve letting go, putting down your burdens (very much like praying, confessing guilt, the yoke) and being at peace with yourself. It is a self-cleansing self-healing process by which we are physically and mentally rejuvenated.

So how did I do today. Going in, my stomach was a little upset from the night before, but by noon it was aching badly for food. I was so hungry it hurt. However, but the afternoon it essentially went away. I did not get hungry until 2am after I jerked off (note: no more jerking off). I think it messed up the good energy I had. Also, I felt my hands were sore in the beginning, as well as some aches in my back.

Surprisingly (cuz I'm such a skeptic), while I was in the right 'state', it felt pretty great. Really, it did. I felt pretty energetic, was not overly exhausted, and most of all, I feel my mood drastically improve. Even now, I don't swear as I'm writing this, and I don't easily get perturbed by things that I expect to trigger me. It is strange...and really surprising bc it's usually the reverse effect when I don't eat.

At the end of the day, we went to a tea conference where people introduced themselves. It was nice, my dad (oh did I mention that he spoke on stage today?) was hot stuff lol. People were from all over the country and it was interesting to hear them talk about their experiences. I also introduced myself and this is where the lady was like 'bigu only Chinese yo'. Lol anyways I was exhausted by 10pm and went to bed.
